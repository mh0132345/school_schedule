1.Teaching by teacher per year (latest year default) like in Excel -> List all course taught by teacher:
select distinct teacher.name, course.name from (((teacher 
inner join teacher_implementation on teacher.id = teacherid)
inner join implementation on implementationid = implementation.id)
inner join course on courseid = course.id);

2.teaching by student group like in Excel (latest year default) -> List the courses which student groups need to learn 
select course.name, implementation.group from implementation
inner join course on courseid = course.id;

Actually I don't understand the last 3 question below:
3.
select distinct(implementation.group) from implementation;

4.
select name from teacher

5.
