1.Teaching by teacher per year (latest year default) like in Excel -> List all course taught by teacher:

select distinct teacher.name, course.name from (((teacher 
inner join teacher_implementation on teacher.id = teacherid)
inner join implementation on implementationid = implementation.id)
inner join course on courseid = course.id);

2.teaching by student group like in Excel (latest year default) -> List the courses which student groups need to learn 

select course.name, implementation.group from implementation
inner join course on courseid = course.id;

Actually I don't understand the last 3 question below:

3. Student groups by degree program

select * from groupstudy;

4. Teachers by degree program (teacher can teach in several degree programs)
select distinct teacher.name, groupstudy.degreeprogram from (((teacher 

inner join teacher_implementation on teacher.id = teacherid)

inner join implementation on implementationid = implementation.id)

inner join groupstudy on implementation.group LIKE CONCAT('%', groupstudy.code,'%'));

5. I don't have data for per week, but I think it should be the same to per year.
